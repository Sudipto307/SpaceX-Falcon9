# SpaceX-Falcon9
Its a Data Science Project where I tried to design a Space Travel Organization to minimise the travel cost.
SpaceX is a Space Research Organization which almost reduced the cost of space travel to 1/3 rd of the previous travel cost.
The reason behind this is their success in recoverng and reusing the Stage 1 of the Space craft.
Here I analysed the reason behind the successful and failure outcomes of recovering the Stage 1 and tried to collect the factors so as to increase the success rate.
